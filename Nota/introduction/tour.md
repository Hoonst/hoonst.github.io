The interface of Nota has four main parts: a file manager on the left, an editor on the right, a tab bar at the top, and quick dialogs that appear when you trigger a quick command like Quick Open (âŒ˜P) or Search (â‡§âŒ˜F).

__File manager.__ The file manager in Nota has a familiar two-column layout. The column on the left shows the folders in your workspace (or main folder) and the column on the right shows the files in the selected folder.

__Editor.__ The editor is where you read and edit your text. It's is the most important part of Nota. To hide the rest of the interface, select View â†’ Editor or by swipe left (right to reverse).

__Tab bar.__ The tab bar makes it easier to switch between the files you're working on. When you select a file in the file manager, its content shows in the editor, but the file doesn't show in the tab bar until you focus the editor. This lets you browse files without thinking about tabs.

__Quick dialogs.__ The quick dialogs in Nota offer a quicker way to work with your content and interact with the app.
